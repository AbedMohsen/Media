## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- Faker to generate massive amounts of fake (but realistic) data for testing and development.
- Redux Toolkit to simplify the development workflow with Redux.
- Axios for a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser.
- JSON Server to get a full fake REST API.
- Classnames for conditionally joining classNames together.
- react-icons to include popular icons in your React projects, which utilizes ES6 imports that allows you to include only the icons that your project is using.
- Tailwind CSS framework to add style.
- React-Redux to let React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update state.
